## Video Description
 
My scene is of a street where a car is in the street with both animals and the
environment is in the scenery. For the lighting requirements I decided to go with
spotlight, area light, point light and directional light. For the spotlight I used
a light post in my scene, and for area light I made the light come out of my main
characterâ€™s(Car) headlights. For the point light I got a carved pumpkin and put the
pont light inside it, because it is the spooky season so it felt appropriate. For
the directional light I used the sun of the scene. In addition, I used the directional
light(sun) to create my day to night cycle. For my particle system I went with a
2d texture emitter and I placed it in the exhaust of the car to make it look as if
the car was on and making smoke.
